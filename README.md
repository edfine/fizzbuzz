fizzbuzz
========

fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge that I have asked in too many interviews.  The keys are understanding % and how if-elif-else work.  
If I am interviewing you, please mention that you looked me up on github and know that this is a question I sometimes ask.  
You will get major points for doing your homework.  If you are interviewing me, please mention that you saw this and you will get
major points for the same.
