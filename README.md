fizzbuzz
========

fizzbuzz is a simple coding challenge that I have asked in too many interviews.  The keys are understanding % and how if-elif-else work.  
If I am interviewing you, please mention that you looked me up on github and know that this is a question I sometimes ask.  
You will get major points for doing your homework (no this is not a gotcha).  If you are interviewing me, please 
mention that you saw this and you will get major points for the same.  Isn't it great when we do our due dilligence?
